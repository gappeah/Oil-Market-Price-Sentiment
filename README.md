# Sentiment Analysis and Visualisation of Stock News

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a powerful tool for performing sentiment analysis on stock market-related news and social media data, followed by visualizing the results to gain insights into market trends. The analysis will involve extracting sentiment from various text sources, correlating these sentiments with stock price movements, and providing interactive visualizations to present the findings.

## Key Features

### 1. **Sentiment Analysis on Financial Data**
   - **Data Sources**: The project will collect data from various financial news websites, social media platforms (such as Twitter or Reddit), and financial reports.
   - **Text Processing**: Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project will clean and preprocess the collected text data.
   - **Sentiment Classification**: The processed text will be analyzed using sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or custom-trained models) to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
   - **Entity Recognition**: Identifying and extracting key entities like company names, stock tickers, or financial terms from the text data to associate sentiments with specific stocks.

### 2. **Correlation with Stock Prices**
   - **Stock Price Data Collection**: Historical stock prices and trading volumes will be fetched from financial APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or other reliable sources.
   - **Sentiment vs. Price Movements**: The sentiment scores will be correlated with stock price movements to determine any predictive relationships or trends.
   - **Statistical Analysis**: Various statistical methods, including correlation coefficients and regression analysis, will be applied to quantify the relationship between sentiment and stock performance.

### 3. **Data Visualization**
   - **Interactive Dashboards**: The project will provide interactive dashboards using libraries such as Plotly or Bokeh to visualize the sentiment data, stock prices, and their correlations.
   - **Time-Series Visualization**: Graphs to visualize sentiment trends over time and how they correlate with stock price changes.
   - **Sentiment Heatmaps**: Heatmaps to show sentiment distribution across different sectors or individual stocks.
   - **Candlestick Charts**: Integration of traditional stock market visualizations, like candlestick charts, with sentiment overlays.

### 4. **User Interface**
   - **Web-Based Interface**: A user-friendly web application built using frameworks like Flask or Django to allow users to interact with the analysis and visualizations.
   - **Customizable Analysis**: Users will be able to select specific stocks, date ranges, or sentiment sources for customized analysis.
   - **Export Functionality**: Options to export the visualizations and sentiment analysis results to various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).

### 5. **Machine Learning Models**
   - **Sentiment Prediction**: Implementation of machine learning models to predict future stock prices based on sentiment analysis.
   - **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training models using historical data and evaluating their performance with metrics like RMSE, MAE, and accuracy.

### 6. **Deployment and Scalability**
   - **Cloud Deployment**: Deploying the project on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalability.
   - **API Integration**: Providing APIs for developers to access the sentiment analysis and visualization tools programmatically.

## Future Enhancements
- **Sentiment Analysis Improvements**: Continuous improvement of sentiment analysis models by incorporating more data and advanced NLP techniques.
- **Integration with Trading Algorithms**: Linking sentiment analysis results with algorithmic trading strategies to test and optimize trading performance.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Enhancing the system to process and visualize data in real-time for timely decision-making.
