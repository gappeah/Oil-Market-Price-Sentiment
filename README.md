# Oil-Market-Price-Sentiment with Machine Learning and NLP

This project focuses on analyzing the oil market by combining machine learning for price prediction with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from textual data.

**Project Goal**

* Develop a model to predict oil prices considering traditional economic indicators and news sentiment analysis.
* Gain a deeper understanding of how news and events impact oil price fluctuations through NLP.

**Data**

* **Primary Data:** Utilize historical oil price data which can be obtained from government sources or financial institutions. 
* **Secondary Data:** Web scraped news articles related to the oil market from financial news websites or energy publications. 

**Methodology**

1. **Data Acquisition and Exploration:**
    * Download historical oil price data.
    * Scrape news articles relevant to the oil market over a chosen period.
    * Explore both datasets to understand the structure of oil price data and identify trends/patterns in news articles.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Cleanse oil price data for any inconsistencies or missing values.
    * Preprocess news articles for NLP analysis:
        * Remove irrelevant information like headers, footers, and advertisements.
        * Tokenize the text into individual words.
        * Apply stemming or lemmatization to normalize words.
        * Remove stop words (common words like "the," "a") that don't contribute to meaning.

3. **Feature Engineering:**
    * Create new features from oil price data (e.g., moving averages, volatility).
    * Apply NLP techniques to extract features from news articles:
        * Identify named entities (countries, companies) related to the oil market.
        * Perform sentiment analysis to gauge positive, negative, or neutral sentiment towards oil prices.
        * Use topic modeling to identify recurring themes in news articles (e.g., "geopolitical tensions," "supply chain disruptions").

4. **Model Building and Training:**
    * Train machine learning models on the prepared data, incorporating both traditional economic indicators and NLP-derived features. 
    * Consider models like:
        * Linear Regression
        * Random Forest Regression
        * Gradient Boosting Regression
    * Hyperparameter tuning will be performed to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate the trained models on a separate testing set.
    * Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the accuracy of price predictions.
    * Analyze the impact of NLP-derived features on model performance. 

**Deployment (Optional):**

* Develop a system to monitor news sentiment and its correlation with oil price fluctuations.
* This could provide real-time insights for traders or analysts in the oil market.

**Tools and Libraries:**

* Programming Language: Python
* Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn (or similar)
* NLP Libraries: spaCy, NLTK (or similar)
* Data Analysis Libraries: pandas, NumPy
* Data Visualization Libraries: matplotlib, seaborn
* Web Scraping Libraries (if applicable): Beautiful Soup, Scrapy (or similar)

**Disclaimer:**

Similar to the previous projects, this is a high-level overview. Specific steps and tools might vary depending on the chosen datasets and desired model complexity.

**Next Steps:**

1. Identify specific sources for historical oil price data and news articles.
2. Choose machine learning and NLP techniques to experiment with.
3. Start with data exploration, preprocessing, and feature engineering.

This project merges traditional machine learning for price prediction with NLP to gain a richer understanding of the oil market. By incorporating news sentiment analysis, you can potentially identify how news and events affect the complex dynamics of oil prices.
